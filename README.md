Things to be done:

  - Consider splitting custom crawler configurations from tracked product configurations
  - Make crawler schedule configurable, parse and use CrawlInterval field in User.properties
  - Consider renaming User.properties to app.properties
  - Use strategy pattern to use different retrieval methods based on crawler type (FUTURE WORK)
  - Change a lot of log info statements to log debug statements
  - Set level of logger to info and debug and test
