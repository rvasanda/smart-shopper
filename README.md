=============

Things to be done:

  - Verify product target page is found using the bruteforce way.
  - Divide links to be visited among threads. (Example: each thread handles 5% of the total links)
  - Have the ability to search for multiple products
  - Make CrawlerBase more generic and include more common functionality
  - Ability to send emails based on whether the product price falls within the price range
  - Log errors to a file to track everything
  - Consider splitting custom crawler configurations from tracked product configurations
