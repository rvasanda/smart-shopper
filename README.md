=============

Things to be done:

  - Verify product target page is found using the bruteforce way.
  - Divide links to be visited among threads. (Example: each thread handles 5% of the total links)
  - BestBuyCrawler: fix bug where no class is found on the current page (Example: .product-title not being found in DOM)
  - Have the ability to search for multiple products
  - Ability to configure price ranges for multiple products. Each product has a price range object.
  - Make CrawlerBase more generic and include more common functionality
